## Creative Coding 2: Custom Pixel

The images for my data mapping project are photos taken of me and my mates in Wellington clubs. In most cases, when we go to the clubs we are drunk and the combination of the flashing lights, crowded area and loud music results in a hazy and blurred perspective of reality. I have tried to encapsulate this effect in my project by creating custom pixel filtering to warp and modify the image to create a trippy effect. I wanted to create a distinctive difference between foreground and background using my masks. Using pixel filtering I could create points of focus in the foreground (me), and have the rest of the image out of focus (random other people in the club). Ive used a warp effect on the background layer of the image using a sin wave and shifting each pixel. This creates a great effect in the background showing how fuzzy everything is when you arent focusing on it. Originally I was using vertical lines randomly placed and shifted to create a trippy effect however I think the warp effect was much more effective. Ive chosen to keep the subject of the image as the original image without any pixel filtering to highlight the focus of the perspective. Finally through development I noticed that in some of the images it was difficult to differentiate the foreground and background layers even with the warped background due to the layers often being the same colour/hue. I fixed this issue by adding a halo effect around the subject of the image using a duplicate of the mask and shifting it. Originally the shift was to the left of the subject but this had some weird clipping issues and I discovered that it actually looked alot better if the halo was above the subject.
